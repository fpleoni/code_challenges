# Code Challenges

We all work on code challenges from time to time. But even more so while looking for new opportunities.

In this repo you'll find code challenges and the solutions I came up with for them, may they serve you well if you're also on the hunt for something new and exciting!

You will also find exercises from "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way" by Zed A. Shaw.
